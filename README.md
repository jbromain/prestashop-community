# PrestaShop Community version
PrestaShop open source e-commerce solution, community version without Prestashop SA modules

This repository stores community versions of PrestaShop, i.e., distributions built from the project https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/

The builds therefore do not contain the modules distributed by PrestaShop SA.

The builds are manually created by me when a new version is officially released, so there may be a few days' delay.

This repository is managed and maintained by Jean-Baptiste Romain, PrestaShop developer: https://www.realdev.fr
