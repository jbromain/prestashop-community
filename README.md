# PrestaShop Community version
PrestaShop open source e-commerce solution, community version without Prestashop SA modules

This repository stores community versions of PrestaShop, i.e., distributions built from the project https://github.com/PrestaShop/PrestaShop/

The builds therefore do not contain the modules distributed by PrestaShop SA.

The builds are manually created by me when a new version is officially released, so there may be a few days' delay.

## What is the PrestaShop community version?

PrestaShop SA, the company, distributes a single version of PrestaShop: this includes the Open Source project, of course, but also many proprietary modules.

These modules are intended for commercial purposes and are not required for the PrestaShop software to function. They are sometimes heavy and can slow down the store unnecessarily.

This community version contains ONLY the Open Source project, including the classic modules.

## How to use this repository?
